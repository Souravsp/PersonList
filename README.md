## Synopsis

I created this very-very simple MVC project using **Spring** framework to get myself up-to-date for new assignment.
I have used Maven for packaging the project, although it never is my first choice, but again needed in next assignment ;-)


## Motivation

As mentioned this project does not solve any practical problem but motivation is just to bring myself up-to-speed.
